3.3. Builtin users

There shall be only one builtin user "Administrator" that is part of the "Administrators" user group.

"Administrator" shall be used at least for initial administration until other administrators are added, but it shall not be possible to disable this user.

3.5. Builtin project user groups

Each project shall contain its own project user group.

4. Access control

TODO


5. Version control

It shall be possible to create branch (or a clone) of a specific historical state of a project to a new project.

For example all trackers and artifacts from that specific historical state of a project shall be copied to a new project. New IDs shall be creadted for all data that contains an ID and all references to these IDs in the new project shall be replaced with their new references while keeping the information of where it was copied from.
